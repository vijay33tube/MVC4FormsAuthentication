http://primaryobjects.com/CMS/Article147.aspx

A basic example of using MVC4 forms authentication with a custom membership provider and custom principal.

Upon logging in, user data is stored in the encrypted forms auth cookie. This allows you to have global access to the user profile data, without having to retrieve it from the database upon each request.
